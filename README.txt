Once you create a stream, simply go to the layout tab, and you can edit the background color, padding, stream title, feed border with different styles, border and feed radius and many more.

= How do I create a stream? =
First you need to generate feeds for either individual Instagram IDs, #tags or location IDs. Then you can go to the Stream tab, and you will get a drop-down menu to choose from all of your generated feed to be included in the stream.
